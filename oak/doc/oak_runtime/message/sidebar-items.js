Note that `Message` and `Channel` objects can be leaked if the Oak application creates cycles of references (e.g. the only reference to a `Channel` is in a `Message` that is held in the same `Channel`)."],["NodeMessage","Encapsulates a message relative to a specific Node, consisting of opaque data bytes together with a vector of ABI handles that are relative to the Node.  This is the internal counterpart of the SDK's `Message` type, whereas the internal `Message` type above holds internal channel references that can be moved between different Node contexts."]]});
